**Demo Survey**
* A little survey built in Oracle Apex, with custom PL/SQL to handle survey questions, responses, and reporting.  Survey is based on the questions from Monty Python and the Holy Grail, and including the New Mexico state question ["Red or Green?"](https://www.sos.state.nm.us/about-new-mexico/state-question/).

    Green chiles are best by the way  :)

**Love's Demo**
* A sample SFDC project to compare fuel prices between several Love's Travel Stops locations, and nearby competitors, prior to joining the company in 2017.  The developer org no longer exists; the documentation is included to show how I organize and work Salesforce projects.
